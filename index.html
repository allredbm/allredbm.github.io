					<p>After spending two years working in the restaurant business, the last six months of which I spent trying to simultaneously learn to code through online classes, I quit my job so that I could fully apply myself to my studies. During this time, I discovered Tech Talent South and successfully enrolled in their Code Immersion program. During the full-time program, I focused on building websites via ruby on rails, as well as front-end design in HTML and CSS and API integration.</p>

					<p>After graduating from High School, I was accepted to attend my college years at Appalachian State University. I spent four years there, during which I earned my bachelor's degree in psychology while acting as an officer in the university's gaming club. After graduating, I decided that I was not interested in pursuing a career in psychology.</p>
