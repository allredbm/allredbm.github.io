			<p>While working at Specbooks, I was a part of a small team responsible for updating legacy code for the Specbooks website, including front-end changes and back-end components. While on this team, I was tasked with writing numerous web scrapers to more quickly and easily obtain product information and specifications from product websites. I also debugged database issues that affected customer experience with the Specbooks website. I primarily worked on a PHP backend with the Symfony framework and in a MySQL database, with a frontend using AngularJS 5.</p>

During this time, I discovered Tech Talent South and successfully enrolled in their Code Immersion program. During the full-time program, I focused on building websites via ruby on rails, as well as front-end design in HTML and CSS and API integration.</p>
